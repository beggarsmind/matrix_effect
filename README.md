# matrix_effect
This code creates a responsive Matrix-style rain effect using HTML5 canvas. Green characters (Katakana, numbers, letters) cascade on a black background. It dynamically adjusts to screen size, recalculating columns and positions. Animation includes fading trails, random resets, and smooth updates every 50ms.
